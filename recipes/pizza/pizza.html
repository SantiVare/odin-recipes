        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the yeast with the water, and stir with a spoon until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Unify the flour with the salt and pour the water onto the flour.</li>
            <li>Mix until you form a solid dough</li>
            <li>Kneed the dough until you feel the gluten has developed. (The dough should be quite elastic and shouldn't be separated easily)</li>
            <li>Let the dough rest in an hermetic container for three to four hours.</li>
            <li>When properly fermented, divide into two separate balls of dough and let it rest in the fridge for 12/24 hours.</li>
            <li>Before you decide to cook the pizza, take the dough out of the fridge for three hours or until room temperature</li>
            <li>Put the oven at maximum (450Â°C max) and preheat for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take a ball of dough and give it the form of a pizza, leaving some air at the borders</li>
            <li>Put it in the oven and cook until done. (Depends on the temperature of your oven)</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
